## How to colaborate
* Fork this repository.   
* Clone the forked repository to your local machine :

   > git clone https_link_to_the_forked_repository   
*  Set this main repository as upstream :
    >git remote add upstream https://github.com/Subhankar4901/Open-IIT-Data-analytics.git   
* Before starting any work always pull the changes other colaborators made :
    >git pull upstream main

* Create a new branch :

    > git branch branch_name   

* Switch to a new branch :

    >git checkout branch_name   

* Now apply the changes.   
* If you are confident with changes you made then, stage the changes and commit them :
    > git add file_name   
    > git commit 
* Then write the commit messege.   
    * **Commit messege should be easy to understand and explain every thing you changed**
* Now merge your changes with main :   
    > git checkout main   
    > git merge branch_name   

* If you didn't counter any merge conflict then it's all okay.   
* If you counter any merge conflicts then read : [Merge conflict article](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches/merge-conflicts)   
* After solving possible merge conflicts push your changes to your forked repository :   
    >git push origin main   
* Then go to your forked repo in github and make a pull request, so that your changes can be applied to the upstream repository.
